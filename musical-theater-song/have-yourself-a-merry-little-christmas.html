            <p>Watch Page Lucky's new version of Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas! Page's focus for this project
                keeps the traditional romantic styling listeners love, while introducing modern jazz elements. Listen to
                the beginning of her cover Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas and enjoy the original music box
                beginning, which changes to a thicker jazz sound a few bars in. The goal was to stay true to the famous
                Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas Judy Garland version, while adding modern jazz additions that
                wouldn't be distracting. When listening to the Christmas song, you should feel like you're experiencing
                an old favorite, with a new voice. The singer really wanted to blend a classical vocal style with fully
                sung jazz technique. When you think of jazz versions, the Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas Michael
                Buble version comes to mind. Frank Sinatra similarly has a jazz versions of the song.</p>

            <p>What makes Page's Christmas song cover different is the true blending of both classical and jazz styles.
                Frank Sinatra and Michael Buble's Christmas songs use a sung and mixed sprechstimme jazz style. This new
                Christmas song is different because it's sung with all of the traditional classical elements, but with
                fully sung jazz styling. That means jazz style is ever present. You'll hear rubato phrasing and lower
                register singing(without the full chest voice as is tradition). Straight tone singing is also used to
                create a different color midway through. The result is a milky finish that stays in the same vocal area
                for a seamless sound. It's manages to maintain everything you love about the original version, while
                seamlessly introducing contemporary moments. You can hear modern phrasing, chromatic passages, and
                Puccini style rubato. As a classical trained singer who specializes in jazz, it features all of Page's
                strengths.</p>
            <p>Starting from the single music box line, it then grows to the climax with chromatic phrasing and thicker
                jazz chords. The new Christmas song then returns to a simple single note, ending with a romantic period
                piano vocalise. It's different, new, and exciting. Enjoy this easy listening Christmas song favorite
                that allows you to reflect while feeling the excitement we all feel at the holidays.</p>
