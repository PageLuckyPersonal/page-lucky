      <h4>Contacting PageLucky.com</h4>
      <h3>Managers & Talent Seekers
      </h3>
      <p>Page Lucky is seeking the right management to raise brand awareness, increase music sales, and produce more performance opportunities. If you are a music manager looking for new music talent, please contact us to discuss your business
        proposal. We are looking! Retainer fee agreements will not be considered without a viable live performance guarantee of a mutually agreed upon amount of bookings per year. If you’re seeking a substitute singer, band, or entertainer for a
        onetime performance event, your partnership is also welcome. All musical partnerships will be considered, and in most cases you will receive a reply within 24 hours.
      </p>

      <h3>Producers</h3>
      <p>Page is available for hire for a multitude of musical projects and non-musical projects. She works as a actress, YouTube singer for hire, music video singer, at live events and more. If you need singers for making music videos or you’re
        seeking singers for TV commercials, all partnerships are possible. Movies, short films, narration, and general MC work are also available services. Email us with a brief overview of your project and what you want to accomplish, and we will
        get back to you shortly.</p>

      <h3>Music Partnerships & Studio Work
      </h3>
      <p>If you’re seeking a singer for a band, or a substitute band singer for a live performance, this is something Page does frequently. Page’s knowledge of jazz, vintage, and classical repertoire is extensive. Filling in for many last minute
        events is usually not a problem. We keep both classic and jazz performance sets available and ready to go for just these occasions. This category includes recording studio work too. Page can be hired to sing your song, perform cover song work
        and perform any other recording session needs. The singer is available for voice over work and readings too.

      <h3>Product Endorsement & Content Creation
      </h3>
      <p>Page can also be hired for creating social media content and writing features. Please notify us ahead of time and these times of endorsements must be scheduled around live performances and other work. Please try to schedule at least two
        weeks ahead of your due date so that we can create your content to the best of our ability. Pricing for blogger product endorsement varies by request and content asked to be created. Page has a videographer, video editor, graphic designer,
        and SEO specialist ready to work on your project from start to finish if required.

      <h3>Response Time</h3>
      <p>We respond most quickly to email! In most cases we can answer any requests, or begin a dialogue about projects, in 24 hours or less. Please try to send us as much information about your event as possible in your first email. This ensures
        that we can send you the most accurate information more quickly. If you reached out via social media, please give us more time to get back to you. Phone calls take the longest for us to respond too as we are in rehearsals and performances.
        Your request is important to us and we get back to everyone in the order of their request, regardless of how large or small. We’re looking forward to hearing from you!
