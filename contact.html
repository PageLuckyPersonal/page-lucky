      <h4>Contacting PageLucky.com</h4>
      <h3>Managers & Talent Seekers
      </h3>
      <p>Page Lucky is seeking the right management to raise brand awareness, increase music sales, and produce more performance opportunities. If you are a music manager looking for new music talent, please contact us to discuss your business
        proposal. We are looking! Retainer fee agreements will not be considered without a viable live performance guarantee of a mutually agreed upon amount of bookings per year. If you’re seeking a substitute singer, band, or entertainer for a
        onetime performance event, your partnership is also welcome. All musical partnerships will be considered, and in most cases you will receive a reply within 24 hours.

      <h3>Response Time</h3>
      <p>We respond most quickly to email! In most cases we can answer any requests, or begin a dialogue about projects, in 24 hours or less. Please try to send us as much information about your event as possible in your first email. This ensures
        that we can send you the most accurate information more quickly. If you reached out via social media, please give us more time to get back to you. Phone calls take the longest for us to respond too as we are in rehearsals and performances.
        Your request is important to us and we get back to everyone in the order of their request, regardless of how large or small. We’re looking forward to hearing from you!
