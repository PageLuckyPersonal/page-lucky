    <h1>True Love Song Cover</h1>
    <p>Page Lucky sings Cole Porter's True Love song with tenor Shawn McDonald at the piano. Videoed at a live performance in Ann Arbor Michigan, this is one of Miss Lucky's most requested songs. It's an old American song hit that features a simple strophic melody and very light accompaniment. In this True Love duet version you'll also be treated to beautiful harmonies from Shawn McDonald. Romantic text, long musical phrasing, and beautiful birdlike singing make it an unforgettable song. Page is asked to sing True Love by Cole Porter typically for weddings and jazz bars. On this occasion Ann Arbor Opera performed a live old school jazz show featuring vintage favorites. True Love was on the list. There are few pieces more loved than a simple love song, and True Love remind you of that every time you see the crowd smile.</p>

<h2><strong>True Love Song Cole Porter</strong></h2>
    <p>Originally written for the film High Society, True Love has remained a great classic in America's song history. Bing Crosby with his crooning, low mellow voice was the first to bring True Love to stardom. Since then several famous singers have covered this famous American song. Since the MGM 1956 release of High Society, it's hard to keep up with the singers covering this beloved composition.</p>
    <p>Part of the secret to this lasting favorite is the simple melody. Songs with simple melody and accompaniment, paired with touching lyrics seem to always find their place in history. The True Love song lyrics are sweet, simple and feature strophic repetition. These are the elements that gave some of our retro song favorites their true staying power. With the text "So I give to you, and you give to me", it comes as no surprise that it's a wedding song favorite.</p>
    <h3><strong>True Love Song Lyrics</strong></h3>
    <li>While I give to you and you give to me</li>
    <li>True love, true love</li>
    <li>So on and on it will always be</li>
    <li>True love, true love</li>
    <li>For you and I have a guardian angel</li>
    <li>On high, with nothing to do</li>
    <li>But to give to you and to give to me</li>
    <li>Love forever, true</li>
    <li>For you and I have a guardian angel</li>
    <li>On high, with nothing to do</li>
    <li>But to give to you and to give to me</li>
    <li>Love forever, true</li>
    <li>Love forever, true</li>

    <blockquote>Sometimes I perform difficult jazz songs at my performances, even ones with melismatic scatting. It will never cease to amaze me when I finish a set, and someone makes a point to come tell me that "True Love" was their favorite.</blockquote>
