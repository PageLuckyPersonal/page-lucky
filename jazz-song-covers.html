            <h1>Jazz Song Covers</h1>
            <p>Jazz covers to popular songs are some of the most performed pieces in night and jazz clubs, especially in
                major cities. There are also popular songs that are arranged into jazz style compositions that were not
                originally published in a jazz format. Christmas songs are a very popoular form of jazz cover song other than traditional jazz song standards.

                        <h3>I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas</h3>
                        <p>In 1942 Bing Crosby sang I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas on a single record that's now sold
                            over 50 million copies. It was written by Irving berlin, but the exact day it was written
                            isn't none for sure. There are too many I'm Dreaming of a White christmas song covers to
                            list here, and new versions are published every year. It's a great song not only for the
                            recording studio artist, by for live performances too.</p>
