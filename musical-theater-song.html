                <h3>True Love</h3>
                <p>Written by Cole Porter, this old American classic was sung by Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in
                    the film High Society. The single later sung by only Bing Crosby with full orchestra was a
                    hit single that's still popular now. There are many True Love song cover arrangements and
                    though not as popular as some of Cole Porter's other songs, it still maintains a position in
                    the spotlight today.</p>
