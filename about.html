        <h3>Planning the Music Theme or Repertoire</h3>
        <p>You do not have to plan the musical theme or repertoire for your event. The singer will select repertoire
          that's appropriate for the setting or mood that you want to create. Any request for a specific song or musical
          number you want will be considered. If you want a specific song performed at a party, wedding or special
          occasion, we're happy to provide it for you. The singer does have the final say on whether or not a song is
          possible, but our goal is to make you happy with the overall performance. Please rest assured that if for any
          reason we deny your request, it's only because we want your event to be spectacular. In the very rare occasion
          that we can not accept a song request, we will be sure to notify you ahead of time. We are happy to explore
          other songs that you may want prefer in exchange of anything we can not accept.</p>
