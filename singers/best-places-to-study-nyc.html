            <p>Many people who like opera music and classical music often have an image in their minds of what we do or
                who we are. However if you haven't actually performed an operatic role before, it's easy to conjure up
                the idea of opera as merely beautiful gowns, extravagant orchestras, and of course, epic death scenes.
                In reality, most of the work an opera singer does to prepare for these moments isn't done with the music
                director or with the orchestra at all. These vocally dramatic moments happen as a result of intensive
                opera score study in dismal coffee shops, dusty libraries, and long days spent at the piano; as singers
                study mostly by themselves. Which raises the question, what are the best places to study music in New
                York?</p>
            <h2><strong>Good Places To Study in NYC</strong></h2>
            <p>That's why I thought it might be nice to share with other opera singers some of my favorite places to
                study my opera scores and classical music in New York City, as well as just places to study nyc. While I
                do travel and perform as a singer for hire in many places, and I <u>love</u> to go overseas, most of the
                bulk of my performances happen in New York City where I'm based. So these are my top 5 places to study
                opera music right now. They do change depending on season and mood(and whether or not they become too
                overcrowded), but whenever I switch spots; I'll repost where my new favorites are.</p>

            <h3>Study Music at the Chipped Cup</h3>
            <p>The Chipped Cup is one of my favorite places to study in Harlem. It’s a medium sized hole in the wall
                coffee shop that’s slightly underground on Broadway. The coffee is tasty and strong, and even though
                they only have a few sweet options to snack on, they do offer free internet. They’re totally cool with
                you parking your laptop and music score on one of their tables for hours at a time. Now with that said,
                the opera singer writing this post – aka me – is Southern, and we are proud of our good manners. So I
                will say this. You’re sitting in a business borrowing their space and commandeering a table. Don’t be a
                jerk. Buy something once an hour or so. They need to pay their bills too and you don’t want them to mind
                seeing you time and time again. You wouldn’t like squatters, so don’t be one. The prices are very
                reasonable here and you’ll need the brain food, so go ahead and indulge.</p>

            <h3>Study Music at Hamilton’s Bakery</h3>
            <p>Hamilton’s Bakery is by far one of my favorite places to study in New York. The coffee is decent, they
                have a variety of hot sandwiches, there are three different themed seating areas, and this bakery has a
                lot of tables. People from all over NYC make the trek to Harlem with their laptops in hand and prepare
                to spend at least five hours working at this coffee shop. The very best part of working and studying
                music in nyc at Hamilton’s Bakery is that the help is staff is friendly and they won’t apply any
                pressure on you to pack up and leave if you’ve been there awhile. They understand that you’re not going
                to sit there working on your laptop or studying music for multiple hours without getting food, drinks,
                and some of their delicious pastries. Words of wisdom for this study spot in the city? They have many
                study tables and also communal tables which are easy to get in the evenings after work hours. If you
                plan on studying at a coffee shop in NY on the weekend, you need to get there early in the morning or be
                prepared to wait for a table. Even with a business that has this much space for customers, because of
                it’s fast popularity, it fills up quickly. Head out as soon as you wake up on Saturday or Sunday if you
                plan on sticking around awhile and want a comfy spot. If you get there early enough you may even get the
                preferred couch seats next to the window!</p>

            <h3>Study Music at Yeoryia Megremis Studios</h3>
            <p>Yeoryia Studios are a wonderful place to study in NY. You can rent entire study rooms here for as cheaply
                as $12 an hour, and all of the rooms have fun opera names. When you call to ask for a room, you may be
                requesting the Carmen, Boheme, or Otello room. These study rooms all have pianos in them for you to use
                at your leisure. Now that doesn’t mean you should waste your time by immediately beginning to study a
                new score in these rehearsal spaces.</p>
            <p>As an opera singer you should know the importance of being able to speak through and memorize the text of
                a score and know the meaning of your music before singing it. Come to these study rooms and study your
                music when your foreign text is memorized and you’re ready to start learning correct rhythms and
                pitches. A lot of times these rooms are also available last minute, so if you need a rehearsal space
                quickly that can accommodate a few people, this is a great music study option.</p>
            <h3>Study Music at The Strand</h3>
            <p>This is an amazing bookstore in New York at Union Square. They have new books and all kinds of old books
                from other customers for sale. By far one of my top 5 favorite places to study. If you’ve visited The
                Strand book store before, then you may be confused as to why I’m listing it. I’ll tell you now that it
                is loud, slightly crowded, and their music score section is lackluster at best. The reason I love coming
                here is because of other aspects of musical study that you can indulge in here. It’s not enough to know
                your opera score and have your opera text memorized. Any decent and professional opera singer for hire
                can sing beautifully and will know their translations. If you don’t have an idea of the time period
                you’re singing in, or how people behaved in that setting, then you won’t be able to portray the
                character correctly.</p>
            <p>That’s where the strand comes in. Some of the best period fashion books and photography books I’ve ever
                seen and purchased have been in this store on the second floor. Know your opera and what time period the
                director plans to set the opera in, and study the social and artistic norms of that setting. Build your
                character to move, speak, and react in the most realistic way that you can. The director will guide you
                when you get to your rehearsals, but you need to go in with your own ideas so that they have a well
                built foundation to work with.</p>

            <h3>Study Music at Bryant Park</h3>
            <p>Bryant park is a wonderful place to study. It’s also a very artist friendly space and they host several
                events there, especially during the Summer. It’s easy to walk by on a random day to find someone playing
                violin or singing there. There are several seats and tables to use where you can study your score while
                basking in the sunlight. Also in this midtown area are a few good restaurants and a good hole in the
                wall coffee shop called Blue Bottle Coffee. If you like sweets there’s an amazing cake shop called Lady
                M Confections to take care of your sweet tooth. You could hang out here all day having delicious food
                and a beautiful view while you memorize your text and rhythms.</p>

                alt="Fountain in the Met Museum in New York City" />
            <h3>Study Music at the The Met Museum</h3>
            <p>I saved the best place to study for last. The Met Museum is my top favorite place to study in New York.
                It’s a long trip from my apartment and I don’t even care. Entrance to the famous Met Museum in New York
                is donation based. If you have the money then be generous because we’re all in the arts, so we know they
                need it. If money is tight, then give a dollar and you’re in. Most areas in the Met Museum are quiet and
                I love the Roman statue section because it’s full of white statues and natural sunlight. It’s quiet and
                there’s a running fountain in the center of the room that’s both calming and inspiring. Sit here and
                learn your music.</p>
            <p>If you’re a hardcore opera singer(I hope you are), then try to find a room that has art from the time
                period that your opera will be set in. Sit in front of those paintings or sculptures and study the
                figures clothing, their facial expressions, or the way they’re standing. All of these things can be used
                to take your performance to the next level. The audience will feel the difference I assure you.</p>
