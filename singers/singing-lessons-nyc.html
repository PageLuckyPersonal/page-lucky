      <h1>NYC Singing Lessons</h1>
      <p>So you’re ready to find the best singing lessons? There are so many voice teachers for hire who are desperate
        for jobs, that looking for the one feels like trying to walk through the Macy’s fragrance department without
        getting doused. Just as there are many well made fragrances and cheap bottles of lingering putrid vanilla
        perfume, so it is also with voice teacher options. How do you weed out the bad ones? Voice teachers can be very
        expensive. In fact one voice lesson may equal the cost of a gorgeous Elie Saab perfume. Just as you may not be
        able to buy a new $180 bottle of perfume once a week, you may not be able to afford a $180 dollar lesson once a
        week. How do you pick the right voice teacher, without buying and trying them all? By following a checklist
        that’s based off of statistics, good old fashioned research, and my own experience with finding the best singing
        lessons nyc. However they apply in any state and country.</p>

      <h3>Past Work Experience</h3>
      <p>If you’re interested in seeing a voice teachers previous work experience, with today’s internet immediacy it’s
        fairly easy to find out where an instructor has performed. Keep in mind that not everybody gets to perform at La
        Scala. You can find a good voice teacher anywhere, but everyone’s life path is different. Keep in mind that it’s
        possible that a voice teacher had children and didn’t wish to spend time away from their new family. In
        addition, some voice teachers enjoy teaching much more than performing. When I refer to “past work experience”,
        I simply mean are they performing currently, and have they been paid to sing? With a simple search you should
        find listings of past performances that a teacher has completed. If the vocal instructor in question has
        frequently been featured in the local news, sings with a paid choir in the area, or is frequently featured in
        the community at small events; these are all good signs that you may have discovered a good voice instructor. If
        you find that a vocal teacher gave performances in other states or abroad, that’s even better, but not
        necessarily required.
      </p>
      <p>Other things you can look for are whether or not the vocal teacher in question has a weekly church gig or works
        at a school or university. These are also excellent details to seek out because it shows that they’re actively
        working and have reasonable expectations where their gigs are concerned. A vocal lessons teacher who has
        performed at The Metropolitan Opera, La Scala, or even a varied list of medium level opera houses in the states
        or abroad is an ideal choice, but finding such a teacher in certain areas could prove to be difficult. If you do
        have a high caliber performer like this available to take lessons with, then by all means try them out.</p>

      <h3>Voice Teachers Referred By Musicians</h3>
      <p>If you have friends who have been studying regularly with a teacher and their voices sound healthy, and they
        actively get an occasional gig; they probably have a good voice teacher. Those students wouldn’t be working if
        other people in the industry didn’t value their voices too. Try out their voice teacher a few times and ask
        yourself afterwards: Did I learn something? Does my voice feel tired, but healthy? Did they seem knowledgeable?
        Do I like them?</p>
      <p>Remember that just because many people favor a particular voice teacher doesn’t necessarily mean that they are
        the right fit for you. You do not need to be best friends with your instructor. On the contrary sometimes these
        relationships thrive more readily when there is a professional boundary between student and teacher. With that
        said though, it is important to like your teacher as a person. If you aren’t able to trust your teacher then you
        will not grow as a musician. Take lessons with someone you trust and respect. You won’t build this kind of a
        relationship in the first few lessons obviously, but if you immediately don’t like someone, the chances of that
        changing drastically are slim.</p>

      <h3>Voice Teacher Website</h3>
      <p>Regardless of how many students an instructor has or what their career was like, a voice teachers website is
        paramount, especially for the best voice teachers nyc has to offer where the competition is steep. We live in a
        day and age where if you’re not online, then you’re not worth talking about. Opera singers who are making it
        today have high caliber websites. Not a Wix website, or a Shopify website, or a SquareSpace website. These
        singers will have a high functioning singer website and will know the difference between the platforms. A
        teacher should only pay Shopify or SquareSpace fees if they’re unfamiliar with development and are selling
        products. Wix websites don’t look professional and will be difficult for future marketers to use to promote you
        when you begin to become successful. A teacher needs to know the difference so that they don’t pay fees for
        something they don’t need, and so that they can promote a professional image. The best singer websites should be
        manageable by marketers, easy for the teacher to update, and user friendly for people trying to discover you.
      </p>
      <h4><i>Why is this important?</i></h4>
      <p>If you attend an audition and the panel has not previously heard of your voice teacher, it’s easy to anticipate
        what anyone looking to hire a singer would do. The panel will look up your vocal instructor on their mobile
        phone to see their website. Google stated this year alone that over 60% of website visits are now coming from a
        mobile phone, and if your voice teachers website looks like a mobile HTML nightmare, it will reflect upon you
        too. Check their website before you throw away a large sum of money for a voice lesson.</p>
      <p>For those of you who are of the opinion that it’s still fine to study with a famous opera singer who has no
        website, I will say this. Currently studying with a famous teacher may still get a vocalist through the door,
        but that period in time is waning. An audition panel may love a singer’s voice, but their paperwork still has to
        flow through the marketing department and the owner of the business. A student’s famous teacher won’t mean as
        much to the business owner as a website that shows a teachers following and students, aka the people they need
        to buy tickets to stay in business. Check their website.</p>

      <h3>News And Press Releases</h3>
      <p>Back in the day finding teacher reviews and singers press releases would’ve involved routing through articles
        or a visit to your public library. Thank goodness we now have the internet. Google the voice teacher you’re
        interested in hiring. Read what other people have said about them and what businesses have reviewed them. Always
        check your sources. If the voice teacher has a positive review from someone whose profession is listed next to
        their author name as “voice therapist” or “throat doctor”, there’s a reasonable chance that they have a right to
        publish such a review. Usually this kind of reputable author tag will even list the writers degree and
        university.</p>
      <h4><i>Word to the wise...</i></h4>
      <p>If the press release you’re reading is by a professional writer at for example, The Huffington Post, keep in
        mind this doesn’t mean that the author has an authentic music degree or medical degree in vocal production. Huff
        Po is a very prestigious company, but if “Bob the editor” has 3 degrees in mathematics and english, this does
        not mean he knows how to teach vocal singing techniques. Look to see who the writer is on any website that you
        find a review or press release on. If you’re able to locate quite a few excellent reviews written by creditable
        sources, then you’ve probably discovered a very fine voice teacher.</p>

      <h3>The Agent Whose a Voice Teacher</h3>
      <p>Ladies and gentlemen be careful. It’s the agent who thinks they’re a voice teacher. You may be referred to a
        “special voice teacher”, the infamous overzealous agent. There’s nothing wrong with singing for agents. I
        recommend that you do sing and audition for agents, good ones that is. Be aware when singing for the voice
        teacher who is an agent because you’re mixing goals. Your goals and the agents’ goals. For the sake of keeping
        this overview brief I will simply say this. Keep these important facts in your mind when deciding whether or not
        to work with an agent.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are their singers getting paid gigs?</li>
        <li>Do they charge a retainer fee?</li>
        <li>Are they charging you for lessons?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Look at the situation through the eyes of the agent. If an agent can charge you a monthly service fee, and
        charge you for lessons, and not get you work; then they are making bank off your hard earned paycheck without
        giving much in return. Unless you can find reviews, press about them, successful singers, and healthy singers
        who are successfully building a career with this agent/voice teacher; then don’t bite the bullet. A good music
        agent will only charge a commission fee on work they legitimately bring you, and it’s very rare that they give
        you voice lessons. Typically a good music industry agent will send you to a voice teacher with a successful
        track record that they trust. If the agent asks for a sizeable retainer fee, don’t waste your time.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Teacher of Languages</h3>
      <p>I can not stress enough the importance of acquiring a vocal teacher who has studied the most widely used
        languages for live performance. If your dream is to acquire an international career, especially in classical
        music, then you need to study multiple languages. If you want to be an opera singer, you should learn to speak
        these languages. Fluency is not required, but you must, at the very least, learn to pronounce them correctly.
        There are differences with the level of teachers you will encounter, and unfortunately what you must pay them
        often reflects those differences, especially for nyc singing lessons. Think about what you would charge for
        voice lessons if you learned to speak 4 languages, played the piano, and also had a decent career. The best
        teachers of this caliber will speak workable English, Italian, German, and French. How much do singing lessons
        cost with the best music coaches? They cost a pretty penny, but they can deliver you to a new level of
        performance, as well as a new level of respect in your industry from your peers.
      </p>
      <p>These are the most expensive vocal instructors. A high caliber voice teacher is not the kind of teacher you go
        to every week. Go to this kind of voice teacher once a month, and only take your best repertoire that’s
        memorized and ready to be perfected. If you’re an opera singer, take an entire memorized role to be worked on.
        Do not ever ask them to plunk out notes for you on a piano. This is not only a waste of your time and theirs,
        but it’s disrespectful to the teacher and a waste of your hard-earned cash.</p>

      <h3>Learn How to Sing - Final Lessons</h3>
      <p>If you want to learn how to sing, then learn. I wrote this article not to give you negative connotations about
        the performance industry, but to help you learn from others mistakes. With as many years of New York performance
        experience as I have acquired, I have twice as many years of mistakes that I have learned from. Read this, print
        it, refer back to it anytime that you’re not sure about a voice teacher that you’re interested in. Remember at
        the end of the day that just because some voice lessons with a certain teacher may work for your friend, may not
        mean that they’re the perfect fit for you. If you get confused swimming through the mass of voice teachers who
        are desperate for jobs and vying for your attention(and money), just ask yourself a few simple questions.</p>
      <p>1. Are you happy?</p>
      <p>2. Are you healthy?</p>
      <p>3. Are you performing?</p>
      <p>If you can answer yes to all of those questions, then you’ve found an excellent fit. Every singer for hire
        struggles with their own path to becoming a singer. Don’t give up and try your best. I won’t tell you everyone
        makes it, because a lot of people don’t. Be realistic with your goals, but still shoot for the stars. You never
        know.</p>
