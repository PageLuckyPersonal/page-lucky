  <h3>Falsehoods About Crossover Singers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Crossover singers are failed opera singers</li>
    <li>They just don’t have the high notes</li>
    <li>A crossover singer gets too tired for dramatic things</li>
    <li>Crossover singers can’t handle memorizing a whole opera</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you’re thinking of pursuing a career as a crossover singer, then you’re probably already aware that none of the above statements about classical crossover singers is true. Still, it’s good to know these things before getting blind sighted by them in the form of thinly cloaked, accusatory questions about your career choice. “Oh I see, and you didn’t like singing with the orchestra? That must have been stressful..”, yeah lady, and so is my barely humane morning commute via the MTA subway every morning. However if snide remarks bounce off of you like Robin William’s “Flubber” invention, do keep reading to find the answer to “what is a crossover singer”.</p>

  <h2>Becoming A Crossover Singer</h2>
  <p>This post is for a classical singer or opera singer for hire who is looking to also work in musical theater or become a jazz singer.</p>
  <h3>Beginner’s Checklist to Becoming a Crossover Artist
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Discovering your voice type’s forte</li>
  <li>Picking your singer brand image
</li>
<li>Getting a grasp on your musical social media
</li>
<li>Accepting the current state of affairs
</li>
<li>Basic fundamental scheduling
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h3>Discovering Your Forte
</h3>
<p>No this is not your voice type “fach”. As a classical singer or even an opera singer for hire, we constantly hear about specializing in the correct fach for auditions. Musical theater and jazz musicians are not obsessed with the fach system. With popular music and more mainstream music, this is about finding out what you sound best singing. If you decided to sing more popular music because you like a certain style of mainstream music, that’s great. If you don’t sound good singing that kind of music, then you need to accept that and find a different kind of repertoire to sell yourself. Many musicians can sing various types of repertoire that sound both beautiful and neatly accomplished. It will take more then that to hold the attention of today’s listener who is assaulted by constant radio, ads, shopping mall music, and youtube videos.

<img class="img-center" src="../images\why-am-i-not-talented-learn-to-be-a-crossover-singer.jpeg" alt="Not everyone is talented and what is a crossover singer">
<p>Listen to different genres, pick out your favorite musicians or bands, and also try listening to music you’ve never heard before by searching itunes or youtube. I would recommend you put together a smorgasbord of these different music pieces, your favorites of course, and invite a general audience to come see you perform those pieces. Label your concert as a free, open to the public evening of music, and encourage people to come. After your concert is over, serve refreshments to keep guests around a bit longer and ask as many attendees as possible which pieces they liked. Don’t bother asking them what they didn’t like. It’s irrelevant what they didn’t like because out of politeness, most of them are not going to tell you. By telling you what they enjoyed and keeping track of their responses, you will inevitably discover what it was that everyone did NOT like as well.</p>
<section>
<h4>Two quick things to note:</h4>
<p>1. You’re trying out new music, do NOT invite important guests to this event who could alter your career.</p>
<p>2. Do not take this time to broadcast yourself as a crossover singer – until you know what type you are.</p>
<p>3. Mom loves everything you do, so her opinion doesn’t count here(sorry moms).

  <h3>Picking A Brand Image
</h3>
<p>Your brand image should give shoppers an immediate feeling of who you are and what it is that you do. You may be thinking well how can I do that in such a small image, but every successful brand has done just that. Think about a few logos for a moment. The first one I think of is Nike, then Delta, Google’s logo, and even the swastika(not all logos are nice). The point is, you immediately feel things when you see these logos don’t you? No one sees a Nike check and thinks, “oh yes, a check mark, I see it.” Everyone knows the Nike logo is Nike, even with no text. Delta and Google and more self-explanatory, but the swastika? It uses no text and yet the second people see it, they are undoubtedly filled with very strong emotions, and for good reason. The takeaway is this. You have to discover a logo that suits your personality, the type of music you plan on making your signature forte, and also just something you like artistically. You need to really like your logo because you shouldn’t change it once you start your career. Every time you alter or change your logo, you risk losing the brand awareness that you’ve built up over the years. Pick something you’re really happy with and that suits you to avoid losing any potential customers and followers that you’ve already gained and held onto. If you want to become a crossover artist, consider having two logos. One performance logo for your classical singing and opera singing events, and another theater singer logo for anything related to your crossover singer work.</p>

<h3>Understanding Social Media
</h3>
<p>Understanding social media for singers, or should I say tolerating social media for singers? Performers, especially crossover singer performers, can be such lively and energetic people. It then becomes very interesting to watch most of these singers struggle or completely fail at social media, especially when it comes to branding themselves online. If you think this will truly be a burden for you, then consider hiring a company to handle your social media on your behalf. If money is tight you can find startups who need every dollar and won’t turn down even the smallest client. Just make sure you check their work regularly. If you really can’t afford outsourcing then you’re going to have to master a skill that almost no performer can. I call it sitting quietly and focusing. Facebook, regular website maintenance, and basic image resizing are beginning social media fundamentals that you’ll need to learn. If you don’t have the time to man 5 social media platforms and can only maintain one social media marketing tool, let it be your singer website. Always try to do more social media, as long as it’s relevant to your brand. As long as what you’re posting is quality, more is always better.</p>

  <h3>Basic Fundamental Scheduling
</h3>
<p>Unless you can afford to pay a company to do all of your social media for you, some of you may be able too, then you’ll be doing this yourself. I will admit that as a singer for hire, this is by far the one marketing item I struggle the most with. Posting to social media with some kind of regularity is difficult if you don’t have a team doing it for you. It’s easy to get lost in the pool of millions of other people who are also posting information about crossover singers or trying to become crossover singers themselves, but you need to participate. You never know where your lucky break is going to come from, whether it’s Facebook, your own website, or even Instagram. If you need to, set reminders for yourself on your phone or calendar. Don’t post photos of random things that you’re doing throughout the day, or things that don’t pertain to your singer brand. It’s better to have infrequent posts that are relevant, than a slew of irrelevant off-brand items that confuse your audience and water-down your brand. Keep it simple, but regular. If you only get one or two items up a week, but those items clearly state who you are and what your brand is, then you’re doing just fine.</p>

  <h3>Understanding Music Today
</h3>
<p>Last and probably the most important aspect of being any kind of singer for hire today, regardless of whether or not you’re a crossover artist, jazz singer, or even an opera singer; is coming to that place of understanding that the music industry is not the same as it once was. What is a singer when considering them as a product? It’s true that some singers, pop artists, and even classical singers are making thousands, maybe millions of dollars in their career; but most of them are not. Just as there’s a Priceline website to make air flight prices competitive, and Google shopping to make product pricing around the world competitive, there is also a music industry with millions on singers making your performance pricing competitive. Go into this new path of life with acceptance of how the music industry, how every industry, is at this moment in time; and find a way to be happy with it. Strive for the best that you can be, but try to embrace happiness with every step that you take on your journey, and do not allow yourself to fall into despair. Hard work is rewarded, so work hard!</p>
