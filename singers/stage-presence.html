<h1>Stage Presence For Singers & Presenters</h1>
<p>You dressed nicely, came prepared, and the audition panel is ignoring you the way you ignore tax return due dates. Truly finding a unique and confident stage presence may take several years of cultivated performance opportunities, but there are some easy things that you can practice in the meantime to make your stage presence better immediately. Here’s a brief layout of what we’ll talk about.</p>

   <h2>Stage presence definition</h2>
   <p>What does stage presence mean? According to Webster's Dictionary stage presence is:</p>
   
   <blockquote>A quality that attracts attention on the stage.</blockquote>

<p>Thanks Webster. It’s always fun to figure out these vague, broad spectrum explanations that you dish out with such graceful anonymity. Now let’s figure out a stage presence definition that’s more helpful to us.</p>
   
<h3>What is stage presence</h3>
<p>What is stage presence, actually? I’m a singer for hire so my needs may be different than others, but not as much as you may think. Many people give important speeches throughout their careers, or have to give direction and advice in board meetings to staff members. Stage presence for every person can come down to one very simple and much more meaningful explanation. What is stage presence? Here’s the answer from my perspective.</p>
<h4>It's what gets you the job!</h4>
<p>Your boss wouldn’t hire someone lacking in confidence to give direction to his staff of 200 – 500 people, least you run it into the ground. An opera director wouldn’t hire a Violetta with no red dresses in her closet, and an advertisement company wouldn’t hire a model that’s lackluster. Oh wait, yes they would. Did anyone see those Gucci ads from 2015? These particular Gucci ads used a photo of what looks like a teenage girl(seen below) to try to sell high end jewelry, because you know, teenagers working fast food have that kind of money. How did she get that job? She probably had amazing stage presence. Stage presence is a huge part of getting hired for any job, no matter the task, no matter the character.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah! Totally gonna’ spend 6 months salary on that!</strong></p>

<h3>Stage presence tips</h3>
<p>You only get one chance with any person you meet to make a first impression. The most important things people will use to sum you up upon the first 10 seconds of seeing you are your clothes, your posture, the way you walk, and your voice. I don’t mean your singing voice alone(if you are indeed a vocalist or singer), I mean your literal speaking voice. You need to know how to deliver a speech well, or how to sing well for an audition, but those are things you will spend hours practicing, maybe years even before you present them.</p>
<p>If you ask someone whether or not they practice walking on stage, or practice the best position for the back, or read about how people psychologically perceive these things, an overwhelming majority of those people will look back at you quizzically with that much anticipated answer of “no”.</p>

<h3>How to Have Presence For Singers</h3>
<h4>Preface Note:</h4>
<p>I want to preface these basic guidelines by saying that the way you walk onto the stage is your moment to set any predetermined notions about yourself. However once you begin your presentation or performance, you should settle into whatever comfortable stance you require for your task. If this doesn’t make sense to you, that’s ok, this side note is more for the singers.</p>
<p>You should keep these stage presence tips in mind throughout if you’re giving a speech or presentation, but for those of you who are singers, the reset is important. Once you start performing you need to sing with good technique. Strive to do everything you would regularly aspire to accomplish with your body during your regular practice routine. Use the following outlined guidelines for the first 10 to 15 crucial seconds that you walk onto a stage or walk into an audition room.</p>

<p><b>The Stage Presence Checklist:</b></p>

 	<li>Posture On Stage</li>
 	<li>Walking On Stage</li>
 	<li>Correct Speaking Voice</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clothing On Stage</h3>
<h4>For Presentations</h4>
<p>Ask yourself instead what you want to portray? Successful people take care of themselves and they dress to kill. If you’re giving a presentation on analytics or research findings, you need to wear a suit or business dress. Men, this means a business suit with matching shoes and belts. You may be worrying about sweating if you get nervous, keep in mind a nice suit jacket is the only thing that will keep the audience from seeing that. Arriving at an event looking professional helps the audience or investors feel that you’re trustworthy.</p>
<p>For the ladies you need at least a knee length dress, and if you anticipate being on an elevated stage of any sort, than below the knee. Before you get defensive, no, it’s not scandalous to wear a mini dress anymore. However it IS distracting. If you want people to pay attention to what you actually have to say, don’t distract them by wearing a short mini dress with animal print. Closed toe shoes are a must, and it’s best for both genders to avoid any kind by bold printed fabric, stick to solids or nice color blocked pieces. For those of you who say “great people walk around all the time in comfy clothes who are really successful”, yes, that’s true. It’s true of people like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and maybe even Leonardo Dicaprio, but for those of us at normal person status; I’m afraid you don’t get to do that. Dress for the occasion.</p>
<img src="..\images\how-to-have-stage-presence-dressed-puppy.jpg" width="80%" alt="" />
<h3>For Singers</h3>
<p>The same holds true for singers attending auditions with a few more extra pointers. Just to reiterate, knee length dresses are a must, and singers should wear for auditions closed toe shoes. If you’re auditioning for a pants role, you should wear pants. Not to be cliche but because you will look more like the character(aka it’s easier for them to go ahead and picture you in the role). Also for a pants role, if you’re busty make sure to wear a straight suit jacket to length your shape. A jacket that hits mid-hip is ideal, and double breasted jackets help hide the bust more efficiently.</p>
<p>A common mistake I see often with singers, is trying too hard to match the role they’re auditioning for. I did just tell you what to wear if you’re auditioning for a pants role, but there’s a fine line. Opera singers may try to dress in a similar style to a character. For example the overdone red dress for Carmen, the sweet girl in simple garb to play Gilda, the full puff skirt for a Le Nozze di Figaro Countessa. In your audition the casting director isn’t just looking for “the look”, they’re looking for a professional. Leave the theater dresses for the theater, and put on professional work attire clothing. They want someone who not only looks like a character, but more importantly, shows up on time and seems like they’d be prepared with their music memorized on the first day of rehearsal. So look professional. There is power in clothing.</p>
<p>An extra tip? If you’re a short opera singer, find a way to take up more space. If you can’t find the perfect audition dress, then have it made. For shorter opera singers I recommend wearing a long dress for auditions, nothing clingy but something in a stiff fabric. If you can find a dress with slightly lifted shoulders or a cute puff sleeve, then that’s even better. You need to establish that on stage you can draw attention, so take up space with the best opera audition dress that you can.</p>
<h3>Posture On Stage</h3>
<h4>For Presentations</h4>
<p>At the risk of sounding like your grandmother, only those lacking in confidence walk around without pulling their shoulders back. Well grandma not really, especially in this day and age when we sit at work hovering in front of our computers all day. When it comes to stage presence though, grandma hit the nail on the head. This doesn’t mean that right before your presentation you arch your back and walk through the door(a common mistake). Stand in front of a mirror, tighten your abs, and concentrate on pulling your shoulders back without overarching your back. A little harder isn’t it? You must embrace correct posture on stage and keep this stage body positioning while you walk on stage or move to the front of the room.</p>
<p>Why is over-arching your back bad? Other than a multitude of other health issues you mean? Though it appears to be a simple change, these two different body positions will inspire very different reactions to the onlooker perceiving body movements. Pulling your shoulders back and tightening your abs sends the message of a confident and approachable individual. It’s easier to just over-arch your back to look confident, but this also pushes your stomach out in front of you, and you risk being perceived as someone who is over confident and unapproachable. This bad back positioning will also shove your hips in front of you which looks, quite frankly, unattractive and lazy. You don’t want that.</p>
<p>Practice having not only good posture but the right posture. After you’ve addressed the audience, as long as you did actually prepare your presentation, you can relax into your normal posture. Why? You needed to win them over in the first 10-15 seconds, once you’ve done that, the rest is up to your work in your profession. The first impression is completed, so if you need to relax your body positioning you can. If you’re an experienced stage presenter then try to maintain your posture throughout.</p>
<h4>For Singers</h4>
<p>Everything discussed above for presentations applies also to singers, with only a few changes. The right body posture is key for the same reasons listed above, but also make sure to wear a smile the moment you walk through the door. Pull your shoulders back, tighten your abs, and put an easy going smile on your face. You’re going to rehearse these movements, but it won’t look like you’ve rehearsed it by the time you perform it. Don’t worry about looking fake, and don’t be afraid to address the panel when you enter. It’s better to have personality than to be professional in the extreme manner of stomping in, announcing your aria, and singing with a full voice. That body behavior screams “I’m totally professional”, which in a way is great. It also screams, “I’m going to be really difficult to work with”. Shoulders, abs, smile, address the panel. It seems like a lot to remember when you’re nervous. I promise it won’t be as long as you rehearse it, just like you do your opera repertoire before attending an audition or singing at a performance.</p>
<p>Remember the preface of this section from earlier? Before you start singing you must reset yourself to your singing posture. Tightened upper abs for singing? Now there’s a terrible idea. Take time to reset if you care about getting that role. I won’t discuss vocal performance technique here, I’ll leave that to your vocal teacher.</p>

<h3>Walking Onto The Stage</h3>
<h4>For Presentations</h4>
<p>We’ve already touched on how to walk on stage briefly, shoulders back, abs tight, gentle smile, and of course this needs to be maintained as you enter the room or walk on and off the stage. This body manipulation is easy enough with just a little bit of practice. Those are the basics of walking onto the stage. For presentations you need to practice audience acknowledgements. At most presentations a pre-speaker or house announcer will come on stage to say all the polite things about yourself that you can’t say without looking like a jerk. AKA, your accomplishments. If you walked onto the stage and said, “listen to me because” and then listed off 50 gold medal awards, they’d hate you. It’s human nature, we can’t help it. So someone came up with the brilliant idea to have someone else do it for you, and it works!</p>
<p>Once you make your successful walk onto the stage with the proper “I am successful and confident” body positioning, you still need to acknowledge that you’ve been invited here and that you’re occupying their space. In other words, humble yourself so that the audience feels comfortable relating to you. For example, “I’m so glad to be visiting you here in Harry’s Potters bedroom closet. I’m looking forward to talking about wizarding spells with you, and am eager to hear your own opinions and questions as well”, ha! Well you get the idea anyways. Let them know that even though you’re successful, you’re also open to new ideas and appreciate that they have their own opinions and thoughts. Tada! They already like you, and you’re instantly approachable.</p>
<img src="..\images\learn-to-have-stage-presence-for-work-and-singers.jpg" width="80%" alt="" />
<h3>For Singers</h3>
<p>Everything for presenters applies here too with slight alterations that are crucial. We must tweak one thing from the list for performers and add another – acknowledgements and purpose. There’s power in thought, and in some magnetic way, the people around you can feel that. When you enter the audition room you need to already be thinking in your mind that you’re successful, the best person for this job, and completely calm. Don’t pretend to feel these things, embrace legitimately feeling these things. It will be felt in the room by the people observing you. Whatever feeling you want the panel or audience to feel about you is was you should emit.</p>
<p>Lastly and equally important are staff and audience acknowledgements. I think we can all agree that no one likes to be ignored right? Even shy individuals and introverts alike enjoy the acknowledgement that they are in the room and a part of what’s going on. Usually when you enter for an audition, you’ll meet the door manager or a marketing individual first. Introduce yourself and ask their name. It only takes a few seconds, and they will appreciate the effort and the acknowledgement that they’re doing something and a part of what’s going on. Next you will typically see the pianist as you’re entering. Don’t just throw your music in their face and turn around. Smile and nod at them(the door guard may have taken your music already), to let them know that you see and appreciate them. Finally turn to face front and greet the judging panel. You don’t like being ignored, the pianist and opera company volunteers don’t like it either. So don’t be rude, a head nod goes a long way.</p>
<img src="..\images\stage-presence-how-to.jpg" width="80%" alt="" />
<h3>Your Speaking Voice</h3>
<h4>For Presentations</h4>
<p>How to speak for presentations. I’m sure you’re anticipating the answer to be, loudly or with a mic. I won’t harp on that. While it is true that your voice should be strong and sure, it’s much more important to project using your whole body(especially if there’s no mic), and secondly to enunciate. Good diction will travel twice as far and twice as clearly than muffled vowels and dropped consonants that are yelled across a room. Take time to really breathe between long phrases or sections of a speech. The more you starve the body of proper air flow, the more tired your voice will become.</p>
<p>Within the business world it’s very common to associate a lowered voice with a more educated person. This is terribly unhealthy for your voice and not a stereotype you should indulge in. Speak in a slightly higher and lifted voice to avoid unhealthily exhausting your vocal folds and damaging your voice. Some people really struggle with this concept. If you can’t tell the difference, take a session with a voice therapist and learn how to do this correctly. It should only take 1 – 2 lessons with them, as long as you’re healthy and there isn’t any per-existing speech problem in the way. If you’re speaking voice is too low, you will hear noise or grating in the voice. If you practice listening for unhealthy noise in the voice, you’ll start to hear it over time.</p>
<h4>For Singers</h4>
<p>Singers sometimes have the opinion that they should try to mimic the personality of whatever character they’re auditioning for. Do not do that. You must present yourself as a seasoned professional. Greet your panel, and announce your first aria with a clear steady voice. Also make sure to practice announcing your aria or art song. Many people sing their opera arias well, but don’t practice speaking the languages. If you announce your aria in poor Italian or sloppy German, you’ve already lost the gig. Foreign language pronunciation matters, and not just while you’re singing. Pronounce your opera music selections using the correct dialect. The opera panel does want to see your character, but it should turn on like a switch the second the music begins playing. If you can truly switch from a true professional air upon entering to an evil queen or an hilarious Cunegonda in the bat of an eye, they will be twice as impressed.</p>
<img src="..\images\queen-of-the-night-singer-opera-blog.jpg" width="80%" alt="" />
<p>I mentioned this for presenters above, but I’ll say it again. Speak in your natural voice and do not lower the pitch of your voice to the point that there’s “noise in the voice”. This is a huge red flag to an opera coach or opera director that you don’t know how to take care of your instrument. No opera singer worth their salt would slam their vocal folds together and cause vocal damage just to produce what they think is a more professional and lower speaking voice.</p>
