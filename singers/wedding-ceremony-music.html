      <h1>Wedding Ceremony Music
</h1>
<p>Singing with a wedding band and being a wedding singer for hire, as you can imagine, I get a lot of special requests. Every now and then a song request surprises me, so I decided to compile a list of the most requested wedding repertoire I’ve had throughout my career. Below is the list of wedding ceremony songs that everyone requests the most from me. Below that, you will find information about each wedding song, why couples have asked for it, and a bit of history about the particular wedding songs’ origins from composer to popular pop singer, and some performance recommendations.</p>

      <h3>Ave Maria by Schubert
</h3>
<p>Ave Maria is by far the number one most requested song that I hear from customers for weddings. It’s an Italian art song by the very famous German composer Franz Schubert. You’re probably already aware that it’s about the virgin mother Mary, but via the pop culture influence is now a standard for music for wedding ceremonies. It’s a gorgeous art song accompanied only by piano as wedding ceremony repertoire, however you won’t typically sing through the entire piece. Usually the bride will simply request an excerpt while she’s walking down the aisle, so maybe one page from the score. It depends on how far she has to go…if you get a grand staircase and there’s a huge turn out, maybe you’ll sing through the entire piece. It’s unlikely though.</p>

      <h3>Sunrise Sunset by Jerry Bock
</h3>
<p>A lovely Jewish song for wedding ceremony music, it’s from the famous musical, Fiddler On The Roof and everyone loves it. You’ll hear many people say that it’s requested for Jewish weddings, and it is, but don’t be fooled; everyone wants Sunrise Sunset sung at their wedding. It’s a great piece for couples whose budget is really tight too because the piano music is extremely easy to play. If you’re looking for a wedding singer for hire, but can’t afford to pay for more than one to three songs, decent singers can play this on the piano and sing it at the same time. You’ll only have to pay for one musician instead of two, as long as you pick your favorite wedding songs appropriately.</p>

      <h3>Can’t Help Falling In Love by George Weiss
</h3>
<p>Can’t help falling in love was composed by George Weiss and made famous by Elvis Presley, also known as “The King”. Though Elvis Presley was the king of rock, this particular love song was a slow ballad with simple accompaniment. Not a lot has changed in how it’s performed since it’s original publish date. The best versions stay true to the ballad accompaniment and use either solo guitar, or guitar and piano trio version with a singer. A truly beautiful wedding ceremony song, be prepared to sing it often at weddings. As a singer for hire you need to be very familiar with this wedding ceremony song. You’ll also be asked to perform this with live bands at special events year-round.</p>

      <h3>The Way You Look Tonight by Jerome Kern
</h3>
<p>I know you’re thinking Frank Sinatra, I love his version of the way you look tonight too. With that said though, I’m going to pay respects to Fred Astaire. Who could ever forget the black and white film with Fred at the piano as he sings along with an unseen orchestra. If you haven’t noticed by now, then you should, some of the absolute most famous love songs in the world are the most simplistic compositions. A simple melodic ballad, strophic stanzas, and occasionally light orchestral accompaniment sung from the heart will last the test of time. This piece in particular is very versatile, whether with piano or a full band, it’s always a stunner. Another great song to pair with the previously mentioned Sunrise Sunset, decent musicians will be able to play and sing it at weddings on their own.</p>

      <h3>I Will Always Love You by Dolly Parton
</h3>
<p>Dolly Parton wrote this beautiful song with simple guitar accompaniment to say goodbye to her professional mentor of many years, Porter Wagner. Oddly enough it’s a farewell song, but because it was written in such a lovely ballad style and with such touching lyrics, it’s a standard wedding ceremony favorite. It’s sometimes sung as music for when the brides walks at her wedding, but it’s also sung at wedding dinners as slow dance music. Though Whitney Houston made a popular belted version, it isn’t suited to a wedding ceremony where the music should be affectionate and touching. No one will watch the brides entrance if you’re screaming into a mic in their faces. Originally written with simple guitar accompaniment, this piece sounds very nice with piano, small ensembles, and even orchestras. If you’re wondering why you’d ever need to sing wedding music with a full orchestra, then you’ve never visited Dubai.</p>

      <h3>Unforgettable by Irving Gordon
</h3>
<p>Nate King Cole made this song famous in the 1950’s, and we’re still obsessed with it. Since then many artists have done different versions from Ella Fitzgerald, Bing Crosby, and even the famous crooner Dean Martin. Unforgettable became literally unforgettable, as in by anyone; and everyone wants then beloved song performed at their wedding in some aspect. The song unforgettable may be used as music for the bride to walk out with, as dinner event music, or even on some occasions both. Don’t be surprised if you sing this repertoire at the wedding ceremony and then have it requested from an attendee at the dance party right afterwards. You can perform Unforgettable with piano, but this famous song was truly meant for a jazz band. If the couples isn’t allowing you to bring in a good double bass player and at least one trumpet then I’d recommend you avoid it. Unless of course they specifically ask you for it, in which case do the best that you can.</p>

      <h3>Everything I Do by Bryan Adams
</h3>
<p>At the number one spot for four months(which is dinosaur years in the music industry), Everything I Do, I Do It For You should not surprise you on this Wedding song list. This isn’t wedding walking music, you’ll probably be asked to sing this for the dinner party or dance event after the formal wedding is completed. As a singer for hire you can make it work with solo piano(after all it IS with piano), but for this piece to really shine it does need an extra musician or two. Strongly recommend to the engaged couple that they allow you to hire a good bassist and a second guitarist if at all possible.</p>

      <h3>Panis Angelicus by César Franck
</h3>
<p>This classic wedding ceremony song isn’t requested by everyone, but those who know their music and have a more discerning palette know it well. Another beautiful piece accompanied by piano, this art song by César Franck is a classic wedding song. Typically sung either as the bride comes down the aisle or as everyone is leaving the venue. If you wedding couple you’re singing for really loves the piece, they may even set aside time for you to just sing it as a solo for their guests. This Latin art song has been made well-known by very famous artists such as Luciano Pavarotti and Renee Fleming.

      <h3>My Heart Will Go On by James Horner
</h3>
<p>This famous song from Titanic was sung by Celion Dion is an common love song that wedding singers are most definitely have in their performance arsenal. At some point in your wedding performer career, you will be requested to perform My Heart Will Go On. Though within the context of the film it’s somewhat of a depressing theme, if you listen to the lyrics out of context, they can be performed with a more uplifting tone. Regardless of it’s origins, it is a moving love song.

      <h3>At Last by Harry Waren
</h3>
<p>Are you ready to compete with Etta James? Didn’t think so. Unfortunately that is irrelevant to the engaged couple looking to hire you. Numerous wedding singers perform this piece beautifully, it’s one of my favorite wedding songs to sing too. With that said no matter who performs it, it’s never quite Etta’s version is it? Learn it like the back of your hand for you shall never escape this song. What you can’t bring to the performance in terms of Etta’s powerhouse voice you will have to equal out with passion and very good acting. The audience will love it, and besides, who doesn’t want to pay their respects to Etta James?
