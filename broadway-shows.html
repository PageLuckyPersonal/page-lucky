            <h3>A note on finding amazing Broadyway shows in NYC...</h3>
            <p>With an abundance of Broadway shows in New York City, it's easy to find great talent around every corner
                and in smaller venues too.
                Watching a show Broadway audiences love in an interesting location is fun, watching one with actual NYC
                locals in a small cabaret venue may even be better. A lot of tourists
                don't know they can find shows at Broadway in smaller venues for half the price. NYC is brimming with
                talented
                singers, actors, dancers and more artists waiting to catch their big break. Instead of seeing a show
                Broadway
                producers have coordinated, save some money and discover someone amazing and locally yourself. Broadways
                shows are
                loud, packed, and fun. However, you're more likely to rub shoulders with interesting New Yorker's,
                people in the music
                industry, and hardcore theater fans in underground bars and performance spaces.</p>
            <h2>Broadway Shows</h2>
            <p><b></b>Page Lucky's Broadway showings</b> often feature a full jazz band with a pianist, double bass,
                percussianist, brass
                section, winds and vocals. She features several Broadway song selections from popular shows on Broadway
                depending on the
                venue. Sometimes material is also partially selected by the sponsoring venue for special occasions and
                seasonal holidays. Every Broadway show New York City event Page hosts
                typically features a section of popular tunes any audience is sure to recognize. A sample of Broadway
                shows New York
                City events from the past live performances are listed here.</p>

                different level, than with shows on

                you they have
                two kidns of jobs. One that pays the bills, and one that fulfills them. The smaller experiences where
                they play
                with their own friends and colleagues is where you'll see them at their best. Visit some of the Broadway
