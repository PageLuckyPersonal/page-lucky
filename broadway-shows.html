    <h1>Broadway Show</h1>
    <p>What could be better than Broadway shows in New York City? Watching a show Broadway audiences love in an interesting location with actual NYC locals. A lot of tourists don't know they can find shows at Broadway in smaller venues for half the price. NYC is brimming with talented singers, actors, dancers and more artists waiting to catch their big break. Instead of seeing a show broadway had to pay big marketing dollars for, save some money and discover someone amazing yourself. Broadways shows are loud, packed, and fun. However, you're more likely to rub shoulders with New Yorker's, people in the music industry, and hardcore theater fans in underground bars and performance spaces.</p>
    <h2>Broadway Shows</h2>
    <p>Page Lucky's Broadway showings often feature a full jazz band with a pianist, double bass, percussianist, brass section, winds and vocals. The singer may feature several selections from shows on Broadway, depending on the venue the performance is at and what the business requests. Every Boradway show New York City event we host ourselves will feature a section of popular tunes you're sure to recognise. A sample of Broadway shows New York City events that we've taken part in, or hosted ourselves, are listed here.</p>
    <h3>How we're different and unique</h3>
    <p>We'll be the first to tell you that we adore NYC shows on Broadway. With that said, sometimes you need a break from the crowds, or want a night to sit at the bar. If you want to meet other music lovers, dirty martini in hand, Page Lucky's shows are a get alternative. The same band members you'll see in Broadway shows at New York City will also be in our little group. If you're more about the music itself, then skip going to shows on broadway in NYC, and go where the performers are having fun themselves. Every musician will tell you they have two kidns of jobs. One that pays the bills, and one that fulfills them. The smaller experiences where they play with their own friends and colleagues are often where they'll tell you to go. Visit some of the broadway shows in NYC that are underground, in cabaret settings, and dingy bars. You're sure to have an intimate experience you won't soon forget. Visit out next event page to catch us and make your own memory! Not only NY City Broadway shows, we visit other states and cities too.</p>
