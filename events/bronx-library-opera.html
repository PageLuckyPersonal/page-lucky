    <h1>Bronx Library Opera Performance</h1>
    <p>Page Lucky sings at the New York Bronx Library. Her solo recital included Broadway hits, standard opera arias, and classical art songs. The concert attendees enjoyed the beauty of the large and modern Bronx library while benefiting from a small but quaint performance space. Some favorites from Page Lucky's solo recital included scenes from Puccini's La Rondine, batti batti from Don Giovanni, and Regnava nel silenzio from Lucia di Lammermoor to name a few.</p>
    <p>An old fashioned upright piano added a lovely old-school music feeling to this live musical performance of classical music and retro Broadway hits. Due to the intimate nature of the space, the audience was able to ask the singer questions about her musical selections and to hear interesting stories about the opera's origins from Inna Leytush at the piano. The dynamic duo felt comfortable sharing with the audience their comfortable playful banter in between musical sets while jumping from genre to genre. Chi il bel sogno was followed by I Feel Pretty from West Side Story which then led into Que sera sera. With a wide and varied list of repertoire, the audience was kept guessing at what musical piece would follow the last.</p>
<p>This Bronx Library show was free to the public and open to library members as well as community members. Allegro Singers and opera singer Page Lucky continue to enjoy a number of different performances and types of performance venues. No performance space is too small or too grand when it comes to sharing classical operatic music with avid listeners. To contact Page Lucky as a singer for hire at your next PR event, library performance, opera performance, or theater show, please email us via our contact form with the details of your event.
