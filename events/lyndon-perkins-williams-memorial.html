            <h1>Lyndon Perkins Williams Memorial</h1>
            <p>Trained classical singer Page Lucky joins Allegro Singers again for a group performance at The Williams
                Memorial Center along with soprano Monique Mcdonald and tenor Joseph Di Salle. This was a free opera
                performance for Memorial Center staff and residents funded by Williams Memorial management as a treat
                for their guests. This was Pages second performance at the Williams Center with a different group of
                singers.</p>
            <p>While Pages first performance at Williams was Russian repertoire heavy with a sprinkling of broadways
                biggest hits, the second time featured beloved duets from Verdi's operas Rigoletto and La Traviata with
                tenor Joseph Salle at her side. Verdi's love duets were followed by Page singing "I Feel Pretty", which
                was performed at her first Williams performance and was brought back by popular demand by attendees.
                Inna Leytush treated the crowd to famous piano pieces by Tchaikovsky, Wagner, and Brahms. Monique
                Mcdonald also performed some newly discovered works that are religious based and air on the more modern
                side of music composition. The opera singer trio wrapped the evening up with a group singalong of Que
                Sera Sera.</p>
            <p>Amongst this weeks song requests were Some Enchanted Evening, selections from Phantom of the Opera, and
                also popular songs from The Sound of Music. While the Williams group audiences always enjoy famous opera
                arias, they were eager on both occasions to add more theater and jazz tunes to their new repertoire
                request list.</p>
