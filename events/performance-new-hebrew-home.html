    <h1>Performance at New Hebrew Home</h1>
    <p>Singers of all voice types joined together at the New Hebrew Home in New York for a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Page Lucky played the role of Gilda along side other well established singers such as Anna Tonna, Neal Harrelson, Gennady Vysotsky, and Claudio Mascarenhas.
    </p>
    <p>When performing at the New Hebrew Home Page Lucky usually sings opera arias along with Broadway hits, so this performance of Rigoletto was something very different. Many audience members could be seen lip singing and following along with the singers in moments during La donna e mobile, Signor ne principe, and caro nome. The members of the New Hebrew Home in New York City have an appreciation for classical and crossover music and know their operas well. It's not surprising when discussing the performance with attendees afterward, that they sometimes have detailed or very specific questions about how a singer manages certain sections of music and difficult dramatic moments. It's also an opportunity to make specific repertoire requests for future appointments.</p>
    <p>The New Hebrew Home takes special care to bring all kinds of different forms of entertainment for their members. This was Page's third time performing in the venue and she hopes to return soon. Their performance space features a very large room with plenty of space for a large audience, a piano, and even a full stage if needed. The side of the room features a wall made entirely of glass that overlooks a quaint garden to set the perfect mood for any fun event, either filling the performance space with sunlight or starlight depending on the time. The staff is incredibly obliging and always easy to work with. Drinks and snacks are always provided to their audience members as well as water for the performers. It's easy to see that the staff truly enjoys their work.</p>
    <blockquote>It's always a pleasure to perform here. You can go in without having any worries and completely stress free. They even start on time!</blockquote>
    <p>Rigoletto has long been a favorite opera to perform for both professional singers and audiences. Arguably one of the best Verdi operas to ever be composed, it's frequently performed in the United States, Italy, France, and Germany. This New York performance of Rigoletto is open for the public to enjoy and free of charge.</p>
    <p>Page Lucky is a soprano for hire in NYC. She performs in large and small venues frequently featured as a crossover singer singing both operatic arias, theater repertoire, and standard jazz favorites with band ensembles. She's currently working on her first CD and anticipates a release by next year in 2018. To hire an entertainer for your next special event, contact us via email or phone for a fast quote.</p>
