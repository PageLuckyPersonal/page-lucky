    <h1>1940's Live Radio Show</h1>
<p>This December Page will be returning to Ann Arbor Michigan to perform with Arbor Opera Theater in their 1940's Radio Show! Among just a few favorites to be performed are Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, I Wanna' Be Evil, Hey Daddy, Not For Me, and Auld Lang Syne. During a this live show and guests will be treated to a pre-new year celebration section in which during the live Ann Arbor performance, the characters will pretend the ball is dropping for the New Year. A full swing band will be present at the venue and the place will be poppin'! Page Lucky and Shawn McDonald are known for not just their singing voices and full swing bands, but also their period accurate costumes. Many period accurate gowns debut at these shows and it's become a well-known and celebrated theme at the Arbor Opera Theater shows. So come join us for excellent music, festive decorations, gourmet snacks, and amazing 1940s gowns. What better way to usher in the New Year than with local Ann Arbor shows and performances, good friends, and amazing vocalists?</p>
<p>Page has already announced that she will make her own costume from a Vintage Vogue pattern, pictures coming soon!</p> 
<p>December 29th and 30th 2013</p>
