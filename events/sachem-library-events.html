    <h1>Sachem Library Events</h1>
    <p>Page Lucky and opera singer for hire and classically trained performer sings at Sachem public library with baritone Ricardo Rosa and soprano Monique Laforza. Celebrating the season with favorite composers of the month, the performing opera group was sure to include arias composed by Verdi, Puccini, and music by Tchaikovsky. From romantic love duets, to dramatic opera scenes, and even classic jazz singer favorites from the musical Show Boat, this singers concert was anything but bland.</p>

    <p>This was the hired opera group's first performance at Sachem Public Library. Upon entry a curious group of classical music lovers, unsuspecting attendees, and a somewhat nervous manager sat on the sidelines eagerly awaiting a performance from the never before seen group. It took approximately 30 seconds after the singers opened their months to feel the collective sigh and relaxation of the attendees in the performance hall. This was going to be a good performance... The first duet was finished with a grand applause, smiling faces, happy library workers, and a confident host. Soon after the audience could be seen mouthing the words to their favorite classical pieces with smiles on their faces. Cell phones were pulled out to take footage with undisguised interest, and a happy photographer eagerly took shots of the expressive faces of the performers.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately for local Sachem Public Library patrons, the library doesn't allow for frequent visitation by any particular group. This is to allow more people to participate in their local events and to ensure a variety of varied performances and events for the locals. If you adored this local free opera concert you'll have to wait until next year 2018 for the next visit from this traveling opera troupe.</p>
