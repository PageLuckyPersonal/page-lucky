    <h1>Opera Singer at Williams Memorial</h1>
    <p>Performing at the Williams Memorial Residence on February 16th, opera singer for hire and crossover singer Page Lucky performed for an eager audience who loved the classics. Soprano opera aria pieces performed were some of Page's most requested coloratura arias with Caro Nome from Rigoletto, Deh Vieni Non Tardar from Le Nozze di Figaro, Glitter and Be Gay from Candide, and Mein Herr Marquis from Die Fledermaus. New pieces for the classical singer consisted of I feel Pretty from West Side Story, and as promised the week before in our previous post, the famous Rachmaninoff Vocalise! The audience requested some standard theater favorites, so Page Lucky also performed some Broadway favorites such as Sunrise Sunset from Fiddler On The Roof, But Not For Me made famous by Judy Garland, I Could Have Danced All Night from My Fair Lady, and a TV classic from the movie Breakfast At Tiffany's entitled Moon River.</p>
    <p>Requested pieces for the next classical singer's performance from audience members were The Nightingale(a Russian folk song favorite) which will be performed at a singing event later this month, and the Act 4 storm quartet from Rigoletto. Page is currently learning a new piano piece with foreign flavor titled Malaguena and also the much beloved opening credits solo piano piece from the newest movie version of Pride and Prejudice, which you can expect to hear soon at least two opera performances in New York City next month in March.</p>
