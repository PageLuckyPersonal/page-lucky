    <p>What kind of journey awaits you? Come little children and be taken away, to where undersea witches brew potions and land monsters are creating new dance moves. Travel with Miss Page Lucky through a Labyrinth and be tempted by the erotic side of your imagination. Learn why mother knows best, and what happens when you disobey her. You'll meet familiar characters and have fun guessing what the next tune is before the person sitting next to you. The skilled pianist, double bass player, percussionist, brass, wind, and vocal performer will guide you through an eerie evening of fun, discovery, and laughter.</p>
    <p>Page Lucky is a classically trained singer who specializes in jazz, opera, and musical theater repertoire. At her concerts, you can expect to hear songs from all three genres to fit the show's theme. The evening will feature mad scenes, songs of deception, and ghoulish movie moments. Why risk a trick or treat when you can simply treat yourself. Her band consists of regularly featured Broadway players ready to entice and inspire you. Think of your table at The Duplex as a gloaming escapism from the mundane for an evening.</p>
    <p>This is the perfect Nightmare Before Christmas to enjoy all of the best Hallow Eve's music together. The perfect preliminary fun to Halloween Day, this Halloween haunt show puts you in a spooky mood just in time for the festivities. This is an adult's and kid's Halloween show, appropriate for all ages. Tickets are $25.00 ($5 more at the door), and there's a two drink minimum per person. All Halloween costumes are welcome and eagerly awaited. This New York City performance space has limited capacity, so please leave your two person horse costume and 7 foot Godzilla costumes at home. To fellow vampires and vampiresses; feeding on other guests will not be permitted. Thank you! Let us plunge into the depths of dispair willingly, hand in hand, to discover what lies beyond the beyond on October 29th, 2019 at 7 PM.</p>
