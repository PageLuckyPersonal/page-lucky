    <h1>East Side Pop Up Opera</h1>
    <p>What could be more fun than surprising an audience with good music? This week Page Lucky, an opera singer for hire in New York, performs on the East side of Manhattan some standard operatic favorites and theater pieces. This particular performances including fun pieces like Mein Herr Marquis, Moon River, Rossini's cat duet, Funiculi Funicula, and Mozart's Susanna Marcellina duet. A small but unsuspecting audience was treated to opera singers in full ballroom attire performing beloved opera aria favorites and fun musical theater pieces. </p>
<p>A small but quaint space allowed the audience to get close and personal with the opera singers. Both performers and audience members mingled throughout the performance, engaging in conversation over favorite musical numbers and discussing future requests. Page is anticipated to return to perform again with new Russian arias by Rachmaninoff, The Snow Maiden Aria, and The Nightingale Song.</p>
<p>Though Page was briefly traveling in Germany and Austria over the holidays, many more performances have been scheduled regularly throughout February and March 2017 and will be posted online. Please stayed tuned for more opera performance announcements and musical theater performances to come that will be open to the public. For more information or to hire a classical singer please email, call, or text management via the contact page.</p>
<p>Below Page Lucky sings at the pop up opera event the famous Puccini aria, Quando men vo from La Boheme.</p>
<h3><b>Quando men vo translation:</b></h3>
<pre>
When I walk by myself in the street
Everyone stops to stare at me
They witness my beauty
From my head to my feet

And then I feel their yearning
which transpires from their eyes
as they perceive my numerous charms
to most hidden beauty
The scent of desire surrounds me,
and it makes me happy!

And you remember and long for me
I see you now recoil from me
But of course I know
you don't want me to see your suffering
but you feel like dying!
