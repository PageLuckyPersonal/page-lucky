    <h1>Somerset Kentucky Christmas Concert</h1>
    <p>We were so pleased to have 73 attendees at the free Christmas concert in Somerset Kentucky this year! This event was sponsored by Watershed Alliance and given freely for the general public. With a beautiful church decorated in red poinsettias, it was the perfect atmosphere for a Christmas show celebration.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by three other locally sourced musicians, the group began with classical music favorites and moved into jazz Christmas repertoire. The Somerset KY music showcase began with I Wander as I Wander, then Mozart's Alleluia, and later featured O Holy Night and Ave Maria. For the jazz Christmas song set the live band performed standard favorites like I'll Be Home For Christmas, Jingle Bell Rock, and Walking in a Winter Wonderland to name a few.</p>

    <p>Most classical concert pieces featured miss Lucky the vocalist alone with the pianist. Christmas jazz sets included the double bass player Dan Harris along with Adam Hopper on the drums. The audience laughed, smiled, and bounced along with Page as she worked the stage Dec. 11th with the live band.</p>
    <p>The group was not only happy with the full church attendance, but also enjoyed the eager participation they experienced with the audience. The show lasted one hour and 10 minutes approximately and the performers hung out at the stage to speak with the audience. There was no intermission, but the jazz ensemble did perform two Charlie Brown pieces during the middle of the concert to give miss Lucky a brief break.</p>
    <p>A special thank you to Watershed Alliance for having the group come in to perform, and also a thank you to Pauline House for arranging the evening. This was a very special performance for the vocalist as it was a return to familiar surroundings. Page grew up only a few miles away from the performance venue, and though most of the faces at the concert were new ones, it was touching for her to be nearly home.</p>
