            <h1>Broadway Hits Special With Page Lucky</h1>
            <p>Sometimes a trained classical singer just needs a break from beautiful opera music and to enjoy a
                performance of Broadway favorites and classics. It was a high energy performance on a Thursday evening
                in New York City with crossover singer for hire Page Lucky performing famous Broadway tunes. With
                musical selections from My Fair Lady, West Side Story, a few of Judy Garland's biggest hits, and famous
                music from old school movies, Page Lucky performed English favorites for an eager audience. With songs
                that the audience loves this much you can always expect a little bit of group singing, and this
                particular light evening performance was no exception.</p>
            <blockquote>
                I'm always surprised at what songs each audience enjoys the most. I'll usually go in predicting that
                they will enjoy for example I Could've Danced All Night, and they'll end up singing along with me during
                west Side Story's I Feel Pretty. You just never know, and that's part of the fun.</blockquote>
            <p>Opera singer for hire and crossover singer Page Lucky is currently preparing new music for performances
                in March of this year. A small sampling of new pieces coming soon are Que Sera Sera, Cadiz, The
                Nightingale, Love Unspoken, You Are Love, regnava nel silenzio, the Lakme duet, Belle Nuit, and a
                surprise piece from the famous opera La Rondine.</p>
            <blockquote>
                I wish more people would make music requests! The best way to discover more music is to ask people what
                their favorites are. Usually I like to ask audience members after the show, but some people are just so
                shy. I get most of my new song selections for future shows from Inna or fellow singers.</blockquote>
