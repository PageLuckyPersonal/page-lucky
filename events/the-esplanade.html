            <h1>Page Lucky Performs at The Esplanade</h1>
            <p>Page Lucky performs in Manhattan, New York at The Esplanade with pianist Inna Leytush, soprano Janette
                Lallier, and tenor HÃ©ctor Palacio. This was a closed performance to members of The Esplanade with
                Allegro Singers, an opera company owned and operated by pianist and opera music lover Inna Leytush. The
                opera concert consisted of standard favorites and featured a vast array of classical operatic music
                selections from for example Norma, Le Nozze di Figaro, Porgy and Bess, and Grenades.</p>

            <p>The opera event in New York was very playful and fun. The audience was quizzed on their opera knowledge.
                Instead of handing out a program, the audience was asked to name famous composers and operas, then
                according to popularity to list arias or songs that they knew well. Many times the audience guessed
                which aria would be performed, with Inna slowly guiding them to the right answer on their own. The
                Esplanade audience members were playful and a very reactive audience, happy to hear and to be part of
                the performance themselves.</p>
            <p>Page Lucky is expected to return to The Esplanade again within the year in which more seating may be
                available, and the performance may or may not be open to the public. If you are looking for a singer for
                hire, please contact Page through the contact form via the <a>contact page</a>, or reach out on Facebook
                at her fan page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PageLuckySinger/">Page Lucky Singer</a>.</p>
