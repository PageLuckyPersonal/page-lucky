    <h1>The New Jewish Home Opera Performance</h1>
    <p>Soprano for hire Page Lucky sings at The New Jewish Home with opera baritone John Greene and soprano Monique Mcdonald with solo arias, musical theater favorites, and operatic duets. Page performed scenes from Verdi's Rigoletto as Gilda and with John Greene as Rigoletto. The New Jewish Home has a nice performance hall with a full stage, but at this particular event the group chose to remain floor level for a more intimate setting.</p>
    <h2>Opera Singer Page Lucky Sings At The New Jewish Home</h2>
<p>The singers stayed after the performance to meet and greet the guests and answer a few questions. The performers also took requests for their next live performance as the Jewish Home writing down musical selections and duet repertoire that the audience was eager to hear again from Fred Astaire favorites to opera music from Le Nozze di Figaro.</p>
<blockquote>One of the best things that I would encourage every performer to do, is to take music requests at least once a week. Pick one of those songs or arias, and spend the next two to three days memorizing it, and perform it at your gig the following week if you can. This means that your musical repertoire is forever expanding and I think, makes you into a better and more rounded musician, no matter what kind of music is your brand's niche.

<p>Page Lucky and John Greene focused on Rigoletto scenes, in particular Figlia mio padre, along with Caro nome, and other Verdi arias. Among the popular performed operatic favorites from Page and John were also some new pieces from Monique Mcdonald which will soon be recorded and published. The singing group ended their music extravaganza with popular theater songs and the popular Doris Day favorite "Que sera sera" as a vocal trio. The group anticipates a return date in the following months or early next year with new opera arias and larger ensemble performances. Inna Leytush plays popular piano tunes chosen by composer's birth month and will announce pieces for the next performance once a booking date has been announced.</p>
