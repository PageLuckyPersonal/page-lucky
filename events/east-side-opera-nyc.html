    <h1>East Side Opera Performance Extravaganza</h1>
    <p>Opera singer and coloratura soprano Page Lucky performs on the East Side in New York for a closed performance of Verdi and Puccini favorites. Scenes from Rigoletto, Die Fledermaus, and Carmen were a few of the scenes performed for an eager audience of opera lovers of all ages. Of attendees favorites in particular from Miss Lucky were a love duet between Michaela and Jose from Bizet’s Carmen, and a Giuseppe Verdi aria from Rigoletto, Caro Nome.</p>

    <p>Page also played a Chopin piano piece for the audience, a particular favorite amongst Chopin lovers entitled Prelude.

Eager listeners in this venue don’t mind hearing new piano pieces and witnessing the practice and dedication required to master popular piano classics.</p>
