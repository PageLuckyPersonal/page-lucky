            <h1>1930's Live Radio Show</h1>
            <p>Page will be performing with Ann Arbor Opera in their much anticipated 1930's Radio Show in which
                characters will be dressed in 1930's appropriate attire and performing as though in a real 1930' radio
                station. Some songs to be performed by Page Lucky consist of Dear Mr. Gable, Embraceable You, a few
                dance numbers will also be included(a special treat for the audience) and some Glenn Miller songs too.
                The director, Shawn McDonald, stated that it will be aÂ romantic and playful evening for performers and
                audience alike. Arbor Opera Theater has increasingly gained more media coverage every year and each year
                tickets sell out more quickly. Purchase soon to ensure that you get a ticket!</p>

            <p>An additional treat? Page Lucky has sewn her own costume especially for the event. Look for the photos
                coming soon!
