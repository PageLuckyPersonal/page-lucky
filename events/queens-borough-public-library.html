    <h1>Queens Borough Public Library</h1>
    <p>What's better than an opera singer singing famous arias for free for the eager ears of New York audience members? Hearing <u>three opera singers</u> singing for free of course. At this beautiful, early day opera performance Page Lucky also sang with two other celebrated local opera singers. The trio consisted of soprano Page Lucky, soprano Liora Michelle Green, and base Gennadiy Vysotskiy, with Inna Leytush at the piano. One thing is certain, with this many different singers for hire, the opera repertoire sung was wide and colorfully varied. Featuring specials from famous Mozart operas, Verdi's grand operas, Donizetti aria favorites, and Puccini romantic aria standards; this free concert in New York City was well attended and packed full of musical flavor. Perhaps one of the most lively audiences of the season thus far, audience members of all ages couldn't help singing along with the famous Tacea aria, and I Feel Pretty from West Side Story.</p>
    <blockquote>This is such a nice place to sing. The piano is full and has a really rich sound, the local music lovers always come out for performances, and the woman who runs the events is so well-mannered and efficient. Their staff isn't just helpful, they're really fun too.</blockquote>
    <h2>Queens Borough Public Library Performance</h2>
    <p>At the end of the performance the local opera singers took turns drawing names for attendees to win free T-shirts to commemorate the free New York music event. The free T-shirt giveaway was organized by the library's organizer and the singers were surprised and delighted to be asked to participate. The free opera concert was well received and all of the trained singers are hoping that the event will be repeated next year as well. With every seat full though, they may need to move the party to the top floor!</p>
