<div class="paragraph-container">
<p>A classical singer is not born overnight, and Page Lucky is no exception. Many moments in her life led her into a musical career and into the performance spotlight. From very humble beginnings to bigger houses and venues, the path to becoming an opera singer included a multitude of varying experiences and knowledge gained from many experienced professionals in the field.</p>
<p>Page Lucky started performing at an early age in the same way many Southern children begin singing, in her local church. The conductor and choir singers at that time remember her well as she insisted at the age of 7 that she sing with the adult choir instead of the childrens choir. The conductor and choir members, not wanting to discourage her in her love of music, decided to allow her to sing in one private choir rehearsal before their holiday Christmas Concert.</p>

    <p>What started as an adorable church story soon became a serious matter in the church when she sang through the entirety of the Christmas Concert amongst the adults surrounding her. Not only was she permitted to sing in the Christmas performance that year, but a serious dialogue continued well after Christmas as to what was to be done about the whole situation.</p>
    <p>Naturally the church members wanted to encourage her, but they also realized that it was important that she spend time with the other children her age. It was decided amongst her parents and the members of the church that she would continue to be allowed to sing in the adult choir so long as she also sang in the childrens choir too.</p>

    <p>At this point Page's parents also felt it important that she take piano study very seriously. Page's mother, Ella (Lou) Lucky already being a pianist herself, had already introduced her to the piano and had been teaching her as a child casually. Husband and wife, Art Lucky and Lou Lucky, observed that she enjoyed playing and discovering new music, but they weren't completely convinced that she was passionate about her lessons. They decided that if she took lessons with a private teacher, she may be more inclined to take her piano lessons more seriously, since family wouldn't be involved.</p>
    <img src="images\eubank ky singer for hire page elizabeth lucky.JPG" width="100%;" alt="">
    <p>They were right in their decision. Page started studying with a local private teacher by the name of Ruth Chitwood, and she began to progress quickly. Page continued to study piano and sing in both choirs for about 3 years. It was obvious by the end of that period that she was indeed passionate about both vocal performance and her piano lessons. After Ruth felt that she had taught Page all that she could, Lou Lucky took Page to see another local teacher by the name of Pauline House, a Julliard graduate and woman with a reputation for being a tough perfectionist with a long list of accomplished pianists under her belt.</p>
<p>With Pauline House things became serious. Pauline possessed a formal music degree from one of the best music schools in the world and had the performance resume to match. Her students were as formidable as was she.</p>
<blockquote>
  Pauline was an absolute no-nonsense teacher, but she was fun too. It all depended on your work ethic. If you came prepared, you would have a fun and rewarding experience; if not...well, that was your own fault.

    <p>Pauline encouraged Page to play piano and to continue singing. After three years of taking lessons and continuing to improve, Page was invited to run the shop for Pauline in return for extra lessons. Not only was she able to have up to three lessons a week this way, but she was allowed use of even the best pianos in the store.</p>
    <p>Page took lessons with Pauline for 10 years throughout most of her early school years and into high school studying Mozart, Debussy, Bach, Satie, Chopin and many other well known composers' repertoire. Playing piano and playing at piano recitals continued to be a constant presence in the her life, but there were many other things that happened during this time to create the musician that you see in her performances today.</p>
    <p>Page continued to play and sing at church, but her first real paying gig was at The Center For Rural Development in Somerset, Kentucky where she played Bach Inventions and Debussy pieces for an artistic gala event. Following this, she soon began playing for local graduation events and private parties too; even singing on television on the local channel the famous song "Blue Bayou". During her first year of high school, the choir director recommended that she begin taking formal vocal lessons and also participate in pageants to learn stage presence. Her first pageant was in Cumberland Falls Kentucky. After winning and becoming Miss Cumberland Falls, it was obvious that this would be yet another great performance outlet for the pianist and singer.</p>

    <p>Also in Page's freshman year of high school, based on the choir teacher's recommendation, she began studying with a vocal instructor at Eastern Kentucky University and soon attended one of their Summer Camps for gifted musicians that changed how she perceived music. The students were put through intensive training for twos weeks in which they stayed on campus and sang in multiple choirs learning both classical repertoire and also performing modern music to modern dance. With the exposure to both dance and also to singing with an orchestra, this was the moment that her interests broadened.</p>
<blockquote>
  I had always known about classical piano music, but this was the first time that I heard classical voice repertoire sung at this kind of level. You had to make the cut to be in the program, and these people were musicians just like me. Even though I had heard music from this period before, it wasn't until then that I really heard it.
</blockquote>
    <p>Page began studying voice with Joyce Wolfe immediately after completion of the camp and continued lessons throughout all of high school and for two more years into college. During that time she built an impressive repertoire list and also gained many singing opportunities, frequently placing and winning at NATS competitions and also performing five operatic roles.</p>
    <p>She went on to attend college for two years at Eastern Kentucky University where she studied voice and piano. She transferred her junior year to the University of Wyoming because of the multiple choir programs that were required as curricular activity for vocal majors. Due to a lack of study time for personal repertoire, she felt she had to look for a different opportunity elsewhere. After transferring to the University of Wyoming, Page began studying with Dr. Katrina Zook, a mezzo soprano who had gained notoriety in Germany. During this time, Page pulled back from studying piano and decided to focus primarily on vocal studies. She performed in the opera each semester, and she studied art song extensively as this was a well known specialty of Dr. Zook.</p>
    <p>Page continued to participate in NATS competitions, choir, and concerto performances, but her greatest accomplishments during this time were learning to speak German at the Middlebury Language School in Vermont, and her performance in Menotti's opera, The Medium, in which she played Monica and was able to rehearse and perform with a full orchestra. She graduated soon after this and after taking a brief break of 6 months at home in Kentucky with her family, she then moved with another friend who sang opera to New York, with a suitcase, no job, and nowhere to call home.</p>

    <blockquote>
      I decided on a Monday that I would just move to New York with a friend of mine, and I did it on that Friday of the same week. I didn't know where I would go, or what I would do, just that it was time to try.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Page has now been living in New York since October 2011 and since then has been auditioning and performing as a wedding singer, opera singer, and as a special event singer both here in the States and internationally. From the Buxton Opera House to a private living room performance, Page has performed in large venues and quaint venues alike.
